## About the workshop
**Introduction to Generative AI**  was an one day online workshop organzied by ENTC, together with IEEE Sri Lanka Section and SkillSurf. The purpose of this workshop was to train and educate interested parties like undergraduates, industry personnel and enthusiasts regarding the growing field of generative AI focusing on manily LLMs and Diffusion Models. The workshop consisted of two sessions, including hands-on training, which talked about how LLMs like chatGPT are implemented and how to finetune image generation models like Stable Diffusion. I contributed to this event by acting as the workshop organizer as well as conducting a practical session on how to finetune Stable Diffusion XL for your own images. 

## Finetuning SDXL using Dreambooth
In my session, I taught how to use [Dreambooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) with the help of a Hugging Face tool named [AutoTrain](https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced). 

All code and tutorials for this and other sections are documented on the [official workshop homepage](https://skillsurf.github.io/introduction_genAI/intro.html).
