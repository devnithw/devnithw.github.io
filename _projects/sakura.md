This is a hobbyist game development project. I used Unity Engine to make a 2D platformer game. The artwork for this game is entirely hand-drawn by me. It is freely available on Google Play Store and you can play the online version [here](https://devnithw.github.io/PlayUnmaskedSakura)

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/us2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/us3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I have open-sourced all the code and the game asset files including sprites and music on [Github](https://github.com/devnithw/UnmaskedSakura)
