Hello world! My name is Chanupa Devnith Wijesinghe and I am a second year engineering undergraduate at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/). I am currently studying Biomedical Engineering at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. I am interested in studying machine learning, deep learning and signal processing with thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics to pioneer effective solutions in the healthcare sector. I am currently in my 4th semester.

Apart from studies I work as the co-director of membership development at the [Rotaract Club of University of Moratuwa](https://rotaractmora.org/) where I have volunteered on various community service projects. I am also an executive committee member of the IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter and the IEEE Signal Processing Society of University of Moratuwa. I am a founding partner and graphic designer at Hypeworks which is a digital media solutions company. I also operate as a freelance graphic designer with 7+ years of experience. 

During my free time, I read books. I like to teach what I learn to other people therefore I write blog articles and tutorials online.
