Hello world! My name is Chanupa Devnith Wijesinghe and I am a second year engineering undergraduate at `University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka`. I am currently studying `Biomedical Engineering` at the `Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering`. I am interested in studying `machine learning, deep learning and signal processing` with thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics to pioneer effective solutions in the healthcare sector.
